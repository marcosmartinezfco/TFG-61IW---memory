\chapter{Social Impact}
\label{imp:impacto}

Do we really need \gls{ai} as a society? There is a lot of controversy around this question and arguments can be found on both sides. Nonetheless, throughout history it has been clear that mankind always looks for tools to finish tasks faster, easier, more effectively, and more conveniently. Thus, \gls{ai} has managed to find a spot in the world during the last decade~\cite{tai2020impact}.

There is a dark side to what \gls{ai} may provide to humanity. There may come a time when human labor will no longer be needed as everything can be done mechanically. Humanity will need to adapt, for example taking care of inherently human tasks, i.e, tasks related with empathy, emotions or social oriented. Some people like Elon Musk belive there is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, due to automation~\cite{elonBasicIncome}.

On the other side, there are several areas where \gls{ai} can have a positive impact such as healthcare, where it can provide multiple benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Faster and more accurate diagnostics.
    \item Reduce errors related to human fatigue.
    \item Improved radiology.
    \item Socially therapeutic robots.
\end{itemize}

Finally, regarding the social impact on financial markets, \gls{ai} can establish a thriving development framework for economic growth given its ease at recognizing patterns. Nonetheless, this can also be seen as a drawback since inequality could be created as investors can end up taking the major share of the earnings, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
